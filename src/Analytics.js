          It’s the chemical in our brains that makes us sit up and pay attention, and rewards us when we discover things that are new, pleasant or dangerous (the fancy term is salience).

For all of human evolution, dopamine was a way to encourage us to seek novelty, take risks, and pay attention to danger.

But lately, with the advent of digital media and one click buying, this powerful motivator has been hijacked, and most of us have barely noticed.

Taking this quiz is just the first step in a much more detailed process of discovery, learning, training, and leveling up your game (if you’re into that).
